## üé® Animation & Interaction Patterns

### Glass Theme Animations

**Entry Animations:**
```typescript
// Staggered section entry
initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 50 }}
animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
transition={{ delay: index * 0.1 }}

// Scale entrance for cards
initial={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0 }}
animate={{ opacity: 1, scale: 1 }}
transition={{ type: "spring", stiffness: 300 }}
```

**Hover Interactions:**
```typescript
// Glass card hover effects
whileHover={{ 
  scale: 1.02, 
  y: -5,
  boxShadow: "0 25px 50px -12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)"
}}
transition={{ type: "spring", stiffness: 400, damping: 10 }}
```

**Background Effects:**
```typescript
// Dynamic mouse-following gradient
background: `radial-gradient(circle at ${mousePosition.x}px ${mousePosition.y}px, 
  rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.2) 0%, transparent 70%)`

// Floating glass orbs
animate={{ x: [0, 100, 0], y: [0, -100, 0], scale: [1, 1.2, 1] }}
transition={{ duration: 10 + i * 2, repeat: Infinity }}
```

### Retro Theme Animations

**Mario Character Animations:**
```typescript
// Walking animation cycle
useEffect(() => {
  if (isWalking) {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setWalkFrame(prev => (prev + 1) % 3)
    }, 150)
    return () => clearInterval(interval)
  }
}, [isWalking])

// Jumping physics
animate={{ y: isJumping ? [-40, 0] : [0, -1, 0] }}
transition={{ duration: isJumping ? 0.6 : 2, ease: isJumping ? "easeOut" : "easeInOut" }}
```

**Game Element Animations:**
```typescript
// Question block floating
animate={{ y: [0, -3, 0] }}
transition={{ duration: 2, repeat: Infinity, ease: "easeInOut" }}

// Coin collection effect
initial={{ scale: 0, rotate: 0 }}
animate={{ scale: [1, 1.2, 0], rotate: 360 }}
transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}
```

**Sound Integration:**
```typescript
// Audio feedback system
const playTone = (frequency, duration, volume, waveType) => {
  const audioContext = new AudioContext()
  const oscillator = audioContext.createOscillator()
  oscillator.frequency.setValueAtTime(frequency, audioContext.currentTime)
  oscillator.type = waveType
  // ... audio implementation
}
```
